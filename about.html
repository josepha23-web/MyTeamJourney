        <h2>MyTeam</h2>
        <p>The MyTeam mode was first introduced in NBA 2k13 version of the game. The main idea for this game mode is for players to collect their favourite players in card form and battle against either the 
        CPU or against online opponents. The main way to get these cards is to open packs that are released weekly or try their luck with the auction house and purchase cards directly from other players with the in-game currency MT Coins. 
        There are different game modes within MyTeam. The two main modes are Domination and Triple Threat Online. Domination mode is a staple in the mode, where players get
their best squad together to complete challenges and compete against the CPU teams which can range from current day squads or historic teams. The main online mode is Triple Threat Online, where players compete against one another in either a 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3. </p>

        <h2>MyTeam Journey</h2>
        <p>I’ve been playing the NBA 2k series since NBA 2k12 and started playing the MyTeam mode when it was released. In this year’s release, the mode started off a bit slow due to the fact there wasn’t much to grind for. Although that did change with the release of a 
            Pink Diamond Jack Sikma card that has great stats that will make usable until December. I started the grind for him playing the Breakout game mode where you must clear a little map of different game modes (Triple Threat Offline, Clutch Time and Full line-up). To unlock the card, 
            you must complete the breakout board 15 different times and collect Breakout Reward cards that were then exchanged for the Season 1 Reward card which then let you choose to pick three different players, Jack Sikma, Glenn Rice and Jason Kidd. Because I mainly play as a centre on Triple Threat Online with friends, 
            I picked Jack Sikma and haven’t looked back since. </p>
